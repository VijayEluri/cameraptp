<p> This provides a jPhoto framework for working with camera
protocols over USB.
The initial such protocol is the <em>Picture Transfer Protocol</em>
(PTP; see www.pima.net).
Support for other USB-enabled cameras may be provided later.

<p> PTP permits an <a href="Initiator.html">initiator</a> and
a responder (think camera) to interact, exchanging images and
other data in <em>pull</em> mode (such as from a
camera to a personal computer) or <em>push</em> mode (to image
storage systems, printers, and so on).

<p> At this writing, cameras supporting this protocol are
just beginning to appear, but substantial industry support
is backing the protocol (including a PTP driver support built
into Windows ME).
